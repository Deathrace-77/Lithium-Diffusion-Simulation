## 🔬 About

This project visualizes why nanotechnology revolutionizes battery performance by comparing diffusion times between micro and nano-scale particles.

Created as part of **The Knowledge Society (TKS)** FOCUS Project.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Controls** - Adjust particle size (1nm - 10µm)
- **Diffusion Coefficient Selection** - High, Medium, Low, or Custom
- **Real-time Animation** - Visual particle diffusion with wave effects
- **Dynamic Charts** - Toggle between diffusion time and improvement factor
- **Baseline Comparison** - Compare against 10µm, 1µm, or 100nm particles
- **Responsive Design** - Works on all devices

## 🎓 Educational Value

**Key Physics Principle:** Diffusion time scales with radius squared (t ∝ L²)

**Real-world Impact:** Reducing particle size from micrometers to nanometers can reduce battery charging times by factors of thousands.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- HTML5 Canvas for animations
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Pure CSS3 styling

## 📊 The Model
t ≈ L² / D

Where:
- **t** = diffusion time (seconds)
- **L** = particle radius (meters)  
- **D** = diffusion coefficient (m²/s)
